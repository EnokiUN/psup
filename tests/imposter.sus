[STORY Electrical]
You practically can't even see 2 meters ahead of you (this story isn't in america yes) but you try your best to navigate to Electrical

this is bad

while slowly walking towards your destination you hear people screaming, no good no good
- OPTION{{
    Walk faster $$STAY,
    Keep it slow $$SKIP 2
}}
You start walking faster, it feels like running
until you hit a pipe and fall down, the imposter probably didn't hear that
you decide to go slower after what just happened
you reach the electrical, "finally" you think
you go inside and see sparkles from where it should be the fuse box from your memory
- OPTION{{
    Fix it $$STAY
}}
not a religious person, but you start praying anyway, or better to say the character does
you open the fuse box and you realize you can't see which fuse is the "red fuse"

    left fuse... $$STORY Death-electrical,
    middle fuse... $$STORY Death-electrical,

}}
and, it's done, the lights are back on, and it hurts, a lot
you quickly go to the vent and hide inside, this is the secret technique you learned by staying in all of those amongus modded lobbies
the imposter is in the room, he can't seem to find you
and you hear the sound of the button alarm...
